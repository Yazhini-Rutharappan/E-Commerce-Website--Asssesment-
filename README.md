Project Overview

This project is an e-commerce website developed as part of an assessment for Crystal Delta. The website is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and implements features such as user authentication, product management, and file uploads. The styling is done with Tailwind CSS, and Redux Toolkit is used for state management.

 Project Objectives:
   - Develop a full-stack application based on the provided design.
   - Implement a functional e-commerce website with basic shopping features.
   - Demonstrate technical skills using both frontend and backend tools.

 Key Functionalities:
   - User Authentication: Sign-up, sign-in, and session management.
   - Product Management: Users can create, view, and manage products.
   - File Uploads: Product images can be uploaded and stored.
   - State Management: Using Redux for efficient global state handling.
     

Tools and Technologies

1. Frontend:
   - React: Provides a modular, component-based structure for building the user interface.
   - Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for responsive and customizable styling.
   - Redux Toolkit: Simplifies state management, ideal for managing the user session, shopping cart, and product data across the application.

2. Backend:
   - Node.js: JavaScript runtime that powers the server side of the application.
   - Express.js: Lightweight web application framework for building APIs, handling routes, and managing HTTP requests.
   - MongoDB: NoSQL database used for storing user data, product details, and other relevant information.
   - Multer: A middleware for handling image file uploads, especially for product images.
